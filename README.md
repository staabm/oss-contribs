# oss-contribs

simple contributions statistics generator

- generates a list of **merged** pull requests in **public** repositories
- generates a list of issues, these pull requests addressed
- generates a count of user reactions on these pull requests and issues

the result is grouped by repository


## Setup / Run

- `composer global require staabm/oss-contribs`
- run `oss-contribs` on your console
  - or use `php bin/oss-contribs` from within the projects folder, in case global composer binaries are not on your PATH

On first run the tool will ask you for an GitHub.com api token.

On any subsequent run you only need to enter a username and a year you want to get the statistics for.
